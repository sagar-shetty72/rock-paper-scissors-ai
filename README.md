# Rock Paper Scissors AI

A Python-based Rock Paper Scissors game featuring an AI opponent that adapts to player behavior using basic prediction. Future updates will introduce advanced strategies, including Markov chains and game simulations.

## Features
- **Traditional Gameplay**: Play against an AI opponent.
- **Basic AI Strategy**: AI uses a weighted mix of random (30%) and predictive (70%) choices.
- **Player Choice Tracking**: Tracks the frequency of player choices and displays percentages.
- **Smart Counterplay**: AI attempts to counter the player's most frequent move.

## Future Improvements
1. ~~**UI Enhancements**: Improve game output for clarity and user experience.~~
2. ~~**Simulated Games**: Add an option to simulate games instead of manual play.~~
3. **Advanced AI (Markov Chains)**: Implement predictive modeling for better AI decisions.
4. **Custom Strategy Weights**: Allow users to adjust the AIâ€™s strategy mix (e.g., 40% random, 60% predictive/Markov).
5. **Difficulty Levels**: Introduce selectable difficulty settings based on AI intelligence.
6. **Game Data Logging**: Store match results for trend analysis.
7. **Adaptive AI**: AI dynamically adjusts its strategy over multiple games.
